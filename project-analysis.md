# Project Structure and File Analysis

This project is a web application for learning blues guitar. It appears to be built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, and utilizes the `AlphaTab` library to display and play interactive guitar tablature.

---

## Root Directory (`/`)

*   **`.dockerignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by the Docker daemon when building a Docker image. Similar in function to `.gitignore`.
*   **`.gitignore`**: Tells the Git version control system which files or directories to ignore (e.g., `node_modules`, build outputs, environment variables).
*   **`Dockerfile`**: A set of instructions for building a Docker container for the application. It defines the environment, dependencies, and commands needed to run the app, facilitating easy deployment.
*   **`package.json`**: The core manifest of this Node.js project. It defines the project name, version, dependencies, and scripts for building, running, and testing.
*   **`package-lock.json`**: An auto-generated file that locks the exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies, ensuring a consistent and reproducible setup across different environments.
*   **`react-router.config.ts`**: The application's routing configuration file, likely used for `TanStack Router` to programmatically generate type-safe routes.
*   **`README.md`**: The primary documentation for the project. It typically contains a project description, and instructions on how to install, build, and run it.
*   **`tsconfig.json`**: The TypeScript compiler's configuration file. It specifies the rules and options for compiling the code.
*   **`vite.config.ts`**: The configuration file for the Vite frontend build tool. It controls the development server, the build process, plugins, and more.

## Automation & Configuration (`.github/`, `.react-router/`)

*   **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**: A GitHub Actions workflow configuration file. This file automates the deployment process, for instance, by automatically building and deploying the application when code is pushed to a specific branch (e.g., `main`).
*   **`.react-router/`**: A directory likely auto-generated by `TanStack Router` to hold generated route-tree type definition files.

---

## Application Source Code (`app/`)

This is where the core logic of the application resides.

*   **`app/app.css`**: A global CSS stylesheet for styles that apply across the entire application.
*   **`app/root.tsx`**: The root component of the React application. This is the app's entry point, where the main layout, router outlet, and global state providers are typically set up.
*   **`app/routes.ts`**: Defines the application's URL routing structure, mapping different paths to their corresponding page components.
*   **`app/api/lesson.service.ts`**: A service file for handling API requests. It likely contains functions to fetch lesson data from a backend server.
*   **`app/config/theme.ts`**: Defines the application's visual theme (e.g., colors, fonts, spacing), possibly for use with a UI library like MUI or Chakra UI.
*   **`app/types/index.ts`**: Contains shared TypeScript type definitions and interfaces used throughout the application.

### `app/store/`

This directory holds global state management stores, likely using Zustand or Redux Toolkit.

*   **`player.store.ts`**: Manages the state for the music player, such as the currently playing track, volume, and playback progress.

### `app/modules/`

The application's features are organized into modules.

*   **`catalog/`**: The "catalog" module, responsible for displaying content like courses and songs.
    *   `components/`: Reusable UI components within this module.
        *   **`ChordDiagram.tsx`**: A component for rendering guitar chord diagrams.
        *   **`Fretboard.tsx`**: A component for displaying a guitar fretboard (showing scales, note positions, etc.).
        *   **`StaticScore.tsx`**: A component for displaying a static, non-interactive musical score.
        *   **`TableOfContents.tsx`**: A component for listing the contents of a course or songbook.
    *   `pages/`: The main pages within the "catalog" module.
        *   **`CatalogHome.tsx`**: The main landing page for the course catalog.
        *   **`ChordTestPage.tsx`**: A page for developing and testing the chord diagram component.
        *   **`LessonDetail.tsx`**: The page that displays the detailed content of a single lesson.
        *   **`ScoreTestPage.tsx`**: A page for developing and testing score-related components.

*   **`player/`**: The "player" module, which provides the core interactive learning experience.
    *   `components/`:
        *   **`PracticePlayer.tsx`**: The core practice player component, which integrates the interactive tablature.
    *   `hooks/`:
        *   **`useAlphaTab.ts`**: A custom React Hook that encapsulates the logic for interacting with the `AlphaTab` library, used for rendering and controlling the guitar tabs.

*   **`tools/`**: The "tools" module, offering auxiliary tools for music learning.
    *   `hooks/`:
        *   **`useMetronome.ts`**: A custom Hook containing the core logic for a metronome.
    *   `pages/`:
        *   **`MetronomePage.tsx`**: The UI page for the metronome tool.
    *   `store/`:
        *   **`metronome.store.ts`**: A state store specifically for managing the metronome's state (e.g., BPM, running/stopped).

## Public Assets (`public/`)

Files in this directory are not processed by Vite but are copied directly to the final output directory.

*   **`favicon.ico`**: The website icon displayed in the browser tab.
*   `audio/texas_rock.mp3`: An MP3 audio file, likely a backing track for a lesson.
*   `tabs/`: Contains the guitar tablature files that the application loads.
    *   **`blues_rock_tune.gpx`**, **`k_on-cagayake_girls.gp5`**, ****`texas_rock.gpx`**: These are Guitar Pro format tablature files (`.gpx`, `.gp5`), which are loaded by `AlphaTab` to render the scores.
*   `assets/`: Contains third-party libraries and resource files.
    *   **`alphaTab.*`**: The core JavaScript files for the `AlphaTab` library.
    *   **`font/`**: Font files for rendering musical notation symbols. `Bravura` is a standard open-source music font.
    *   **`soundfont/`**: SoundFont files (`.sf2`, `.sf3`). These are instrument sound banks used by `AlphaTab`'s audio synthesizer to generate realistic instrument playback for the tabs.
